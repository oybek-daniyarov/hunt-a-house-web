# HuntAHouse AI Engine

A sophisticated AI-powered property research and listing generation system built with TypeScript and Next.js.

## Overview

The HuntAHouse AI Engine is an advanced workflow-based system that transforms natural language property queries into detailed, accurate property listings. It combines multiple AI agents and tools to create a seamless property research experience.

## Key Features

- üß† **Intelligent Workflow Engine**: Orchestrates complex multi-step AI operations with built-in retry mechanisms and error handling
- üîç **Natural Language Processing**: Extracts key property requirements from user queries
- üè† **Property Research**: Conducts thorough property research using multiple data sources
- ‚ú® **Smart Listing Generation**: Creates detailed property listings with relevant information
- üìä **Built-in Analytics**: Tracks processing time and usage metrics for optimization

## Architecture

The system is built around three main components:

1. **Workflow Engine**: Manages the execution of complex AI tasks with error handling and retries
2. **AI Agents**: Specialized agents for keyword extraction, property research, and listing generation
3. **Tools**: Utility functions for embedding generation and property data processing

## Implementation

```typescript
// Example workflow creation
const workflow = createPropertyResearchWorkflow(query);
```

The system follows a step-by-step process:

1. Extract keywords from user query
2. Research property details
3. Generate comprehensive listing

## Usage

The AI engine is integrated into the Next.js application through API routes and React components, providing a seamless user experience for property searches.
